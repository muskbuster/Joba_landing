# init

Incase the path names are still a problem

please use gitpod gitpod has one extra hierarchy called workspace which has to be mentioned while mentioning path.

So go to gitpod -- https://www.gitpod.io/

signup with github

create new workspace

put the url of repo I.e -- https://github.com/muskbuster/init

It will open the repository --> npm install --> cd joba --> npm install --> npm start this will resolve the errors
