# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



Incase the path names are still a problem 

please use gitpod 
gitpod has one extra hierarchy called workspace which has to be mentioned while mentioning path.

So go to gitpod --  https://www.gitpod.io/ 

signup with github

create new workspace

put the url of repo I.e -- https://github.com/muskbuster/init

It will open the repository 
-->  npm install
--> cd joba
-->  npm install
--> npm start
this will resolve the errors
